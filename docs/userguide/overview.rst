Domino Overview
===============
Domino provides a distribution service for Network Service (NS) and Virtual Network Function (VNF) descriptors. It is targeted towards supporting many network controllers, service orchestrators, VNF managers, Operation and Business Support Systems. Producers of Network Service Descriptors (NSDs) and VNF Descriptors (VNFD) use Domino Service as an entry point to publish these descriptors. Currently Domino only supports Tosca Simple Profile for Network Functions Virtualization (http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/tosca-nfv/v1.0/tosca-nfv-v1.0.html) as the data model for NSDs and VNFDs.
