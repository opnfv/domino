Domino Overview
===============
Domino provides a distribution service for Network Service (NS) and Virtual
Network Function (VNF) descriptors. It is targeted towards supporting many
network controllers, service orchestrators, VNF managers, Operation and
Business Support Systems. Producers of Network Service Descriptors (NSDs)
and VNF Descriptors (VNFD) use Domino Service as an entry point to publish
these descriptors. Currently Domino only supports Tosca Simple Profile for
Network Functions Virtualization (http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/tosca-nfv/v1.0/tosca-nfv-v1.0.html) as the data model for NSDs and VNFDs.

Orchestrators, controllers, and managers use Domino service to announce their
capabilities in the form of policy labels. For instance a Virtual Infrastructure
Manager (VIM) that is capable of performing an affinity based VNF or VDU
placement at host machine granularity can specify a label in the form "tosca.policies.Placement.affinity:properties:granularity:hostlevel". When the VIM registers
with Domino Service and subscribed for that label, Domino views this VIM as a 
candidate location that can host a VNF or VDU requesting affinity based placement
policy at host machine granularity.
