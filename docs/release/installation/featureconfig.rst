Domino Configuration
====================
Domino Server and Clients can be configured via (i) passing command line options
(see API documentation) and (ii) the configuration file "domino_conf.py" under the
main directory.

* The default file for logging is set as none and log level set as "WARNING".

Domino Server
-------------
* The default server unique user ID is set as 0 in the configuration file.

* The default TCP port for RPC calls is set as 9090 in the configuration file.

* The default database file for Domino Server is set as "dominoserver.db" under the main directory

* The default folder for keeping published TOSCA files and pushed parts is set as "toscafiles" in the configuration file via variable TOSCADIR.

Domino Client
-------------
* The default mode of CLI is non-interactive (i.e., Domino CLI Utility is used). This can be changed when the DominoClient is launched by passing the flags --log or -l followed by the
log level choice from the set {ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG} (not case sensitive). This overwrites the log level default specified in the configuration file.

* The default Domino Server IP is set as "localhost". This can be overwritten at the time of launching DominoClient via the option flags -i or --ipaddr followed by the IP address of the actual server hosting the Domino Server.

* The default Domino Client TCP port for RPC calls is set as 9091 in the configuration file. It can be overwritten when the DominoClient is launched by passing the flags --port or -p followed by the port number.

* The default folder for keeping preceived TOSCA files is set as "toscafiles" in the configuration file via variable TOSCA_RX_DIR.
